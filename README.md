# virtual_plasmid_digest
Authored by Myung Chang Lee (Noah Lee) circa June 2019, to make my life easier instead of plugging away different combinations in Benchling, etc.

Generates plot with the predicted band sizes resulting from plasmid restriction enzyme digest.

The code is able to ingest multiple plasmid sequences as well as enzymes to perform virtual digest.

The plasmid sequence included in the FASTA files are deposited on Addgene, as part of AMBRA1 Tuba-seq screening. Here are the associated Addgene links: [AMBRA1](https://www.addgene.org/browse/article/28220069/), [Tuba-seq](https://www.addgene.org/browse/article/28233110/).

Here are some example virtual digestion images:
